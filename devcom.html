        ><span class="along-the-streets"
          >Along the streets of AB Fernandez Avenue stands vendors that sell
          products ranging from bracelets, face masks, cologne, and even fruits.
          They stayed on the sidewalk and endured the heat and dust just to sell
          their products and earn their products’ worth. With the recent road
          construction for the Flood Mitigation Project, a few things changed in
          their business.<br />
          <br />When people think of business, they think of the establishments
          that will be affected by the road construction along AB Fernandez
          Avenue, where plans for the Flood Mitigation Project have been ongoing
          for almost half a year.<br />
          <br />The following paragraphs will be an insight of three individuals
          who are sidewalk vendors who have their business affected by the
          rising of the road and later on, the sidewalks. Their participation is
          voluntary, and their names will not be mentioned in the post for them
          to stay anonymous while one respondent gives their consent to post a
          picture but will not be named for their privacy.</span

          >They do not and will never blame the progress of the city, they even
          encourage it in hopes that the flood problem to stop. But there are a
          few things that disappointed them, mainly the change in their profit
          compared to when the project did not start yet.<br />
          <br />The first interviewee stated that it does affect them greatly in
          profit. Being a sidewalk vendor near AB Fernandez Avenue, their
          current profit runs from 400 pesos a day, and the second interviewee
          had a profit of 4,000 pesos before the construction and it
          significantly changed and stayed at half profit once the construction
          started.<br />
          <br />When asked if they would change their location once the sidewalk
          construction happen, the three respondents stated that they will
          remain in their location and the only thing that will change is the
          height of the road.<br />
          <br />All of them hope that their past profit will come back at some
          point when all the road constructions are done.<br />
          <br />Their cases are similar to the other sidewalk vendors around AB
          Fernandez Avenue. The charge of unloading and loading commuters and
          the loss of parking spaces along the side of the road are the major
          causes of loss of profit.<br />
          <br />Yes, there are students from PHINMA-UPang and other campuses
          that walk around the sidewalk to avoid the traffic but they still
          barely make any more money than before.</span
        ><span class="their-feelings-about-change"
          >Their feelings about change</span
        ><span class="their-feelings-about-change-c"
          >The third respondent stated that she would never disagree with the
          city’s decision for progression. She had been a sidewalk vendor at the
          tender age of 19 years old and as she was in her seventies already,
          she had witnessed different kinds of change in Dagupan City.<br />
          <br />As she has lived in the city all her life, she experienced the
          progression of the city and encountered different projects of the
          government. She does experience the impact of the Flood Mitigation
          Project on her business but it does not put anger in her heart rather
          it saddens her that she can only provide the half profit to her four
          grandchildren.<br />
          <br />The hardship of being a street vendor in a progressing city is
          heavy. The uncertainties of their location and the uneven result of
          their profit continue to settle on their shoulder like a boulder,
          however, it does not make them stop providing for their families.
          Their sacrifices and hardship as a vendor do not lessen their love for
          their family. As long as they are alive and well, these three sidewalk
          vendors will never stop earning for their families.<br /> </span
        ><span class="patience-is-virtue">Patience is a virtue</span
        ><span class="progression-welcome-benefit"
          >Progression is welcome for them, they do not mind it as it will
          benefit them in the end once the road construction on AB Fernandez
          Avenue is finished. Like somehow their wish for the completion of the
          construction is heard, the Department of Public Works and Highways of
          Dagupan City announced that the deadline date of the finished road
          construction will be March 15, 2023, for AB Fernandez Avenue, March
          30, 2023, for Arellano Street, and April 15, 2024 for MH Del Pilar
          Street.<br />
          <br />Hope for the completion is near, The private sector is also on
          board for the project completion as this project will be one of the
          countermeasures of the government to the flood problem of the city.<br />
          <br />As the sidewalk vendors wait, talking to them about the changes
          might ready them for the progress of the construction, they are very
          in favor and nothing will make them say no as it will help them
          because they are also being affected by the flood, they just hope that
          the project will left its helping hands and continue to make a
          progress for the betterment of the city and the relief of its
          citizen.</span
