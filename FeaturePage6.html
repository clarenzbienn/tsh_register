              “Turkey in the Straw” playing while you read this, why don’t you allow
              yourselves to imagine—to reflect and realize that it’s a small world
              after all? Even if it did take a hundred years to build it.</span
            ><span class="dream-career-animator"
              >The world was vast, however, through the mental lens of Walt Disney,
              who decided to put his all into building his dream career of being an
              animator in the 1920s. In 1923, he and his brother Roy had came up with
              “Alice Comedies”, a series of shorts based off of Alice’s Adventures in
              Wonderland (which would then become its own full-length film made by the
              latter in 1951). He had soon found himself a distributor for the series
              in October of 1923, which then became the formal start of the Disney
              Brothers Cartoon Studio.<br /><br />After four years, he had created his
              new cartoon hero, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a silent cartoon series about
              the everyday misadventures of the titular character, mostly including
              his love interest, Ortensia the Cat. But only after just a year and 26
              episodes later, his distributor had decided to take the rights to Oswald
              for himself, along with most of Walt’s team of animators.<br /><br />Disheartened,
              he then had to come up with a new character that he could truly call his
              own—and at his last of three attempts, he had created his new star—and
              one that would a sensation to all throughout generations. With the debut
              of “Steamboat Willie”, the very first Walt Disney short to ever include
              sound, also came the debut of what would become the studio’s main mascot
              to this day, Mickey Mouse.<br /><br />“Steamboat Willie” would follow
              Mickey as a sidewheeler on a steamboat, who jams along with Minnie in
              the most comic way to the sheet music she brought along of “Turkey in
              the Straw”, and sending the message of finding the positive side of
              every situation despite unwanted setbacks and company.<br /><br />The
              successes of Walt Disney would continue, bringing in many firsts for the
              company as well. In 1932, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves” would make
              its big screen debut as the first animated movie to be shown in English
              and in full color. Also, Walt Disney would be the first to introduce the
              “mini-series concept” for television in 1954, with “Davy Crockett”, and
              the first to be able to develop a theme park intended for the entire
              family—Disneyland—in Anaheim, California, on July 17, 1955. To this day,
              it is still one of the most popular family destinations in the
              world—often dubbed “The Happiest Place on Earth.”<br /><br />Even after
              Walt Disney’s death from lung cancer on December 15, 1966, Walt Disney
              Studios had, and still continued to make timeless classics both for
              television and the silver screen, with the latest addition to the
              distinguished roster being “Wish”, a 2023 film of wondrous magic and
              willpower that debuts a new Disney Princess, African-American Princess
              Asha (She is also the second African-American princess made by the
              company, after Tiana from 2009’s “The Princess and the Frog”).<br /><br />On
              October of 2023, Walt Disney Studios celebrated its 100th Year
              Anniversary, with the release of the short film “Once Upon a Studio”. It
              showcases all of our favorite Disney characters ever created in the very
              same studio, all gathered together for to take one grand family picture.
              (Well, blood-curdling antagonists weren’t invited, though.)<br /><br />Looking
              back, Walt Disney Studios has shaped generations of classics and
              continuous, failproof waves of nostalgia. One can truly spot a Disney
              movie or song from even miles away—every animated symbol that always
              finds time to reawaken our inner children that never really died, but
              only put to slumber.<br /><br />With the Disney magic within each one of
              us, we can find ourselves making everything possible—whether it be a
              trip to Neverland, a tour around the magical Madrigal family home,
              finding people worth melting for, or just simply getting lost in
              Fantasia in the midst of troubled times.<br />And at the end of the day,
              whether or not our wishes upon a star come true, we can always seek
              comfort in faith, family, and fun—until we find ourselves with the
              happiest hearts on earth, filled to the brim with the kind of happiness
              that transcends many more centuries to come.</span
