            ><span class="age-doesnt-matter-1"
              >"Age doesn't matter," they said.</span
            ><span class="grooming-case"
              >However, some take it too far -- even below the age of consent -- to
              justify their ‘love’ for each other. Other times, they wait for the
              younger person to turn eighteen as a pass to not get caught in the
              act. Take EJ Laure for example, who only admitted to the rumors on her
              involvement with Bugoy Carino, as well as the pregnancy, as soon as he
              turned 18 in 2020.<br /><br />Well-known couples with grooming include
              Julia Montes and Coco Martin, who went public with their relationship
              in 2023, stating that he tried to court Julia when she was 13, he was
              25. I can certainly go on and on about more cases, but one thing
              remains: It’s all about how the media somehow normalized grooming.<br /><br />According
              to CNN Philippines in a September 2023 article, the Philippines ranked
              second in online sexual abuse and exploitation of children.<br /></span
            ><span class="what-is-grooming">What is grooming?</span
            ><span class="child-sexual-offender"
              >According to the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MCASA),
              grooming is an act of  exploitation where a child sexual offender
              takes advantage of the younger individual, a minor, for sexual favors
              while maintaining secrecy. They even go as far as obtaining parental
              consent by gaining their trust and share a pattern of targeting
              victims, often vulnerable young kids.<br /><br />Perpetrators deny
              allegations and often cloak it in lots of excuses such as 'love'. Some
              even claim that they are just 'helping' these children with their
              problems, reinforcing some sort of savior complex in their head.<br /></span
            ><span class="media-grooming"
              >How did the media manage to normalize grooming?</span
            ><span class="love-team-culture"
              >The media, as we all know, is one of the forerunners in shaping
              society for the better or worse. They provide platforms for the
              general public, especially public figures like celebrities.<br /><br />The
              love team culture has introduced us to pairs like Liza Soberano and
              Enrique Gil, also known as LizQuen, who starred in shows like Dolce
              Amore. Soberano was 17 at the time she dated Gil, and no one seemed to
              bat an eye. Elvis Presley married ex-wife Priscilla when she was 21,
              he was 32 but met her at 14. <br /><br />No calls for accountability
              were ever made until years later. Soap operas have long conditioned
              society to believe in the notion that love knows no age nor
              boundaries.<br /><br />It’s true, but it only applies to adults. Not a
              minor and an adult.<br /><br />Love stories have told us it’s fine to
              go after an older person or entertain one, thinking it’s fine without
              any repercussions. They veil it under the guise of ‘maturity’. To
              them, it’s a perfectly normal romance, almost as normal as every
              teenage Wattpad novel-turned-movie.<br /><br />Apart from this, you
              get romantic tropes shown in lots of media where they emphasize ‘the
              right time’ and purely waiting for your love. This only applies to
              couples with no questionable age gaps and a valid reason to wait — not
              waiting for the time where they won’t consider themselves prisoners.
              Sweetie, even if he says he’s waiting for you to turn 18 before you
              two can make it official, you better run. That does not make anything
              better.<br /></span
            ><span class="wrong-reasons">Why is it wrong?</span
            ><span class="exploitation-involving-children"
              >First and foremost, it's literally a form of exploitation and
              involves children. Even if one tries to excuse it by saying that minor
              and adult romantic relationships don’t necessarily involve grooming,
              it is still downright inappropriate to actively pursue a 13-year-old
              freshly out of elementary school or entertain people under 18 who
              confess having romantic feelings for you. No, it is your obligation as
              an adult to protect the wellbeing of a child, not exploit them by
              reciprocating their feelings.<br /><br />“My parents were 25 and 41
              when they got married!” Honey, your parents met when they were adults
              with computer science degrees and employment.<br /><br />Moreover,
              waiting for them to turn 18 isn’t morally correct, either. You are
              only looking for a free ticket out of jail and a facade to make your
              relationship seem legal. No one can just say that it’s the same person
              when they are both in different ages – there never was any reason, at
              all, to justify acts like this.<br />“Oh, she’s in the age of
              consent,” The age of consent is literally 16, only signed in 2022 from
              the previous 12 years old. That’s still lower than 18, barely an adult
              and hasn’t seen 18 roses at her debut.<br />You’re just taking
              advantage of youth and twisting the truth in your favor, the same way
              you take advantage of how the media feeds you the wrong information if
              you are not careful enough.<br
