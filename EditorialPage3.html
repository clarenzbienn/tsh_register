                  for them by their parents. How many people in this world embarks too
                  hard on something they don’t enjoy but continue to do so because
                  they are subjected to it? How many burn-out students continue to try
                  too much because of unsettling high expectations from their elders?
                  Surely, we don’t know the exact numbers, but how many times have we
                  heard the same stories? How many times have we seen this plot on
                  telenovelas and movies? Many times. At this point, it could even be
                  a generational curse passed down to us. A folklore of some sort.
                  People put themselves into heavy ordeals and try to achieve academic
                  feats for the sake of compliance but often never because they wanted
                  to. As a result, they lose themselves and their self-identity trying
                  to gain something they never wanted in the first place.

                  cause of why putting pressure on kids to achieve more than they can
                  take is because of money. As a country with limited and
                  top-of-the-notch requirements to get working opportunities,
                  graduating with a good academic background backing you up is a key
                  to escaping poverty and establishing a good life. In a sense,
                  pushing kids to achieve greatly is somehow translatable to securing
                  them a good life. Although usually well-intentioned, pushing them
                  over the top to the point of scarring them for life, is never a
                  reasonable excuse.<br

                >Strict parents often argue that putting pressure on kids is necessary
                to keep them working and aspiring for the best. “Diamonds are made
                under pressure,” they say. But is pressure really necessary? Do we
                have to put our offsprings in a situation where they question
                themselves and their abilities when goals are unmet? Or would it be
                possible to choose to support them with positive reinforcements and
                moral affirmations to keep them grounded and sane?
                <br /><br />Checking on your kid’s academic welfare every now and then
                and making sure they’re doing alright is great. However, being too
                uptight on their academics often do more bad than good. It takes a
                toll on the children’s mental health and might manifest into more
                serious issues. This is backed by a study conducted by Howard et al.
                (2019) where he investigated the linkages between authoritative
                parenting and academic success. Results showed that “parents who
                engage in overparenting, such as restricting autonomy and
                intrusiveness negatively impacted their students’ success in college.
                It interferes with the child's ability to develop a sense of autonomy
                or competence. It may undermine a child’s ability to take full credit
                for their accomplishments, resulting in lower self-esteem.”<br /><br />However,
                on a separate study conducted by Steinberg (1989) and Dehart (2004),
                it is stated that “Children who described their parents as treating
                them warmly, democratically, and firmly were more likely than their
                peers to develop positive attitudes and beliefs about their
                self-esteem, self-concept, and achievement. Consequently, these
                children are more likely to do better in school.”<br /></span

                >Burning with passion or just burn-out?</span
              ><span class="tender-nourishment"
                >It is without a doubt that a parent’s tender nourishment and
                comforting words nurtures a child to become a perfectly molded adult.
                It is understandable that parents only want the best for their kids.
                Still, sometimes we must let the children find their way to their
                dreams so they can become an accomplished adult without the emotional
                baggage of misplaced pressure that would burden their lives.
                <br /><br />We can either have child burning with passion, success,
                and a light heart for what they want or a burn-out kid living a
                successful life with nothing but a heavy heart.<br
