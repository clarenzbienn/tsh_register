              >Hans Ardane C. Catabay is a 19-year-old student from Aporao, Bani,
              Pangasinan. He is currently in his second year of Bachelor of Science in
              Civil Engineering at the PHINMA-University of Pangasinan (PHINMA-UPang).
              But unlike most of his classmates, Hans has a different passion: fashion
              designing.</span
            ><span class="fashion-design-passion"
              >Hans grew up in a family of tailors. His grandfather made custom
              dresses and uniforms for students, and Hans was fascinated by the art of
              creating clothes. He developed a keen interest in fashion, especially in
              designing his own outfits. He dreamed of becoming a runway model or a
              fashion designer someday.<br /><br />However, when it was time to choose
              a college program, Hans faced a dilemma. Fashion design was not a
              practical career option in the Philippines, especially for an only
              child. His parents wanted him to study at PHINMA-UPang, but the
              university did not offer a fashion design degree. Hans had to settle for
              civil engineering, a field that he was not fond of.<br /><br />“It’s
              hard, honestly. Since mathematics is not my thing, I was stumbling
              around in the dark. Fortunately, I am gradually adjusting to the real
              nature of my degree; nonetheless, I still long for the day when I may
              finally follow my greatest interest, perhaps after completing
              engineering,” Hans said.<br /><br />Despite the challenges, Hans did not
              give up on his passion. He continued to design and make his own clothes,
              using his creativity and skills. He also participated in various fashion
              events, such as the Lumiere pageant hosted at College of Engineering and
              Architecture Festival last September 2023, where he wore his own
              creation.<br /><br />“That was my second concept that I was able to
              effectively bring to life, however it’s more costume-like and not the
              typical type of my design style,” Hans said. He described his style as
              “simple but elegant, with a touch of edginess.”<br /><br />Hans also
              shared his message to other students who have a passion that is not
              aligned with their college program.<br /><br />“Just realize that time
              is your ultimate ally. Never give up on the things you love, even if you
              can’t always get what you’ve wanted. Never underestimate the power of
              time and destiny; if it is meant for you, the universe will always find
              a way to make it happen. One day you will look up from your feet and
              realize that this is what you have longed for and sought,” Hans said.<br />Hans
              also expressed his hope that PHINMA-UPang would offer a fashion design
              program in the future.<br

              >“This is my actual dream. I often ponder myself if uPang had offered
              fashion design instead of civil engineering, would I have continued to
              pursue that course of study? You know, uPang is pretty diversified in my
              opinion, and if there was a fashion design degree offered here, I would
              love to see those who truly love fashion expand their horizons. Students
              would be able to reach their full potential and make a valuable
              contribution to the fashion industry,” Hans said.<br /><br />Hans Ardane
              C. Catabay is a student who lives by his motto: “Always make an impact,
              make the Cma hallway a fashion runway.” He is an example of how one can
              pursue his passion, even if it is not aligned with his current college
              program. He is an inspiration to those who want to follow their dreams,
              no matter what obstacles they face.<br
