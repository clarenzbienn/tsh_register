            <p class="for-black-people-n">
              For black people, &#34;n*gga&#34; is used as a term of endearment to recognize one as a friend or a
              &#34;buddy&#34;. It is an adaption of the word &#34;nigger&#34;, a Latin term for black people, inevitably
              the Africans, which was attached to the African slave trade in 1619, where Africans were sold as slaves
              mainly for the Americans, stripping their human rights off by treating them as no less than animals. The
              attachment of the word to this blood-soaked history seems to be under the shade of racial slur being
              treated as a surface level profanity. Evident to people, particularly the young, using the word often
              without any knowledge of the context behind this word.

            <p class="p">Our Non-existent Monopoly on Words</p>
            <p class="it-s-simple-if-you">
              It&#39;s simple; if you&#39;re not black, you shouldn&#39;t have a say about when or how to use the
              n-word. It&#39;s racist. Putting the focus on the etymology on the n-word, the black community had indeed,
              revived the slur and used the adapted word as a form of endearment. However, it does not give us,
              non-black people, the permission to use the term AT ALL. The reclaim does not change the history the word
              holds for their community. Moreover, the frequent use of the word in general as a provocative term, does
              not desensitize its naturally offensive connotation, hence the continuous backlash for its use.  It is our
              responsibility to educate ourselves on these matters, especially when issues like these have been
              anchoring our progress in fostering a safe and inclusive society since time immemorial.

            <p class="text-wrapper-3">The Weight of the Word</p>
            <p class="i-once-asked-a-high">
              I once asked a high school student (intentionally as he takes part of the highest exposure of false media
              in the spectrum) if he thinks people who say the n-word must face a consequence. His answer was &#34;No,
              tapos na ang slavery ng black people matagal na so bakit kailangan mag suffer nang mga taong nag sasabi ng
              n-word ngayon? Lagi namang naririnig sa mga kanta.&#34; If you&#39;re struck, that makes two of us.
              Let&#39;s look at the facts.<br /><br />In an exclusive cover of CNN Africa in 2017, they discovered slave
              auctions of Africans in Libya. Further information from news articles in 2017 states that 71% of migrants
              experience slavery, particular races mentioned were Eritreans, Somalis and Nigerians. Therefore no, black
              slavery is not completely eliminated in the modern world. <br /><br />Slavery is not over, racism is not
              over. But say they are, the weight this word carry will never be lessened by any ounce. Black people
              cannot get over of the blood-soaked past because the world never allowed them to, and this is manifested
              in the modern day slavery, the use of n-word by the non-black people, and the general amount of
              disproportionate oblivion of the people of the mere facts such as the marginalization, and stagnant
              position of black people in the socio-economic ladder.

            <p class="the-world-of-trends">
              The world of trends is so fast paced, &#34;hypes&#34; change from one minute to another. And while it is
              part of our human nature to seek dominance, accentuated in this generation as being seen &#34;cool&#34;,
              you as a tech-savvy, and well rounded digital native must hang up to the call of this sense of
              &#34;coolness&#34; in using the n-word or literally any word that holds power in situating people or a
              community in harm or disgrace. Acknowledge that a &#34;trend&#34; in its own avenue can make you believe
              that because people does it, it&#39;s not wrong. It&#39;s high time we invest our attention to research on
              social issues as we are at the peak of information availability, there is no excuse to justify one&#39;s
              unawareness. The recurring issue of the use of the n-word is one of the most talked about topics through
              the years; history, articles, and other media resources are available. What else do we need?
