        >Two teams of undergraduate students from the PHINMA-University of
        Pangasinan have won prestigious awards in the 2023 IEECP LUPANG SC
        Undergraduate Research Competition, a regional event that showcases
        innovative projects in the fields of science and engineering.</span
      ><span class="phinma-university-pangasinan-teams-b"
        >The first team, named SMART-RAFT, won the Best Capstone Award under the
        Mechatronics and Robotics category for their project that aims to
        develop a smart and autonomous floating aquaculture aid. The SMART-RAFT
        is an aquaculture device that has three main functions: aeration,
        feeding, and tracking. The device can monitor the water quality, feed
        the fish, and track what are the volumes of feeds that is being fed. The
        team consists of Lenald D. Pacleb as the lead researcher and also the
        presente , and the members are Patrick Jaus P. Catabay, Angelica Mae B.
        Obcena, and Junnel D. Soriano, who are all students of the Bachelor of
        Science in Electronics Engineering program.<br /><br />The second team,
        named iCARE, won the Best Paper Award under the internet of things
        category for their paper that proposes a novel system for monitoring
        basic health assessments using wireless sensors and cloud computing. The
        iCARE is a healthcare assistant device with three major features: WiOX
        for oximeter reading, WiSeer for UV light disinfection, and WiNotif for
        notifications. The device can measure the oxygen saturation level,
        disinfect the room using UV light, and alert the user or the caregiver
        using a mobile app. The team consists of Jasper R. Barbozan as the team
        leader, Guerlaine Faye Q. Nitas as the presenter, and the members are
        Kassandra Mae L. Finuliar, Kenneth Jeremie C. Ferrer, and Junel B.
        Prado, who are also students of the Bachelor of Science in Electronics
        Engineering program.<br /><br />Both teams were coached by Engr. Fermar
        Fajardo, a faculty member of the College of Engineering and Architecture
        at the PHINMA-University of Pangasinan.<br />The 2023 IEECP LUPANG SC
        Undergraduate Research Competition was organized by the Institute of
        Electrical and Electronics Engineers - Philippines Section (IEEE-PH) and
        the LUPANG SC Foundation, a non-government organization that promotes
        science and technology education in the country. The competition was
        held in Lyceum-Northwestern University on October 1, 2023.<br /><br />Both
        teams are going to advance in the National Finals with three stages
        which are the screening, semi-finals, and finals round. The screening
        and semi-finals round will be held online while the Finals round will be
        held in face-to-face set-up in Marikina City on October 26, 2023<br />As
        part of their awards, both teams will also have the opportunity to
        present their projects at the International Conference of Pangasinan and
        Bolosan Studies, which will be held in Lingayen on November 20-22, 2023.
        The conference is an annual event that features multidisciplinary
        research on various aspects of Pangasinan and Bolosan culture, history,
