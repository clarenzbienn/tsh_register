      <span class="student-leaders"
        >Student leaders from nationwide gathered in the International Assembly
        of Youth for UNESCO 2023 at Manila Opera Grand Hotel in which various
        clubs were recognized, participated in other exciting activities, and
        discussed different sustainable development goals that were aligned with
        the program that would later contribute in helping and achieving their
        significant purpose by the end of 2030.<br />
        <br />According to John Aldrin M. Balazon, UPSTO President, they were
        the first student organization in Phinma-UPang to be accredited by
        UNESCO Club Philippines. “We are given the opportunity to influence our
        constituents about the programs of UNESCO like quality education and
        lifelong learning that is aligned with our organization’s mission and
        vision, and of course, our own institution,” he said.<br />
        <br />During the process, Pres. Balazon also mentioned that the process
        to be one of the UNESCO Clubs was very rigid, as it requires 3 levels of
        accreditation interview in which every step is getting further harder.
        He also expressed, “But one thing's for sure is that our advisers, Mr.
        Mahrionne Luis B. Revilla and Ms. Charmee Rae P. Velasco, are always
        there to support us and always remind us to stick to and uphold our
        organization’s mission and vision because it is the reason why we want
        to be accredited in the first place.”<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <br />According to him, there were a lot of participants nationwide who
        wished to be one of the UNESCO Clubs, but only 82 were officially
        accredited. “I am proud to say that there are 3 UNESCO Clubs from
        Pangasinan and one of them is UPSTO,” he added with pride.<br />
        <br />Noreen Irish S. Bautista, UPSTO Secretary, also shared her
        highlights from the event, expressing, “Being one of the participants in
        the Y4U event made me feel so honored — it was really enlightening to
        observe the accreditation and other activities that happened. I digested
        so much learnings from a variety of speakers, making every moment a
        pearl of wisdom. It was an unforgettable experience!”<br />
        <br />When asked what could be improved through the process, she
        replied, “If there was anything that could be done better, I would like
        to see better information made available to everyone, myself included,
        on the event schedule and better communication about it. Overall, I
        absolutely liked the experience there and I would love to attend the
        next Y4U event. So, I say, let's make waves for a better world!”<br />
        <br />John Aldrin M. Balazon, Noreen Irish S. Bautista, Lester Kenneth
        A. Dioquino (BSED English Representative), and their adviser, Mr.
        Mahrionne Luis B. Revilla, formally received the recognition as UPSTO
        representatives.<br />
        <br />Looking forward to more assemblies in the future, UPSTO will
        promote and conduct Sustainable Development Goal #4 — a quality
        education and lifelong learning through various events.</span
