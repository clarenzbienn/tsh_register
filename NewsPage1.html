        the 5th PHINMA Education Student Leader Summit hosted by PHINMA
        University of Iloilo last November 15 to 17, 2023.</span

        >PHINMA-University of Pangasinan, both from Dagupan and Urdaneta
        campuses, along with 8 other PHINMA Education schools attended the 5th
        PHINMA Education Student Leader Summit that was hosted by
        PHINMA-University of Iloilo.<br /><br />With the continuation of the 5th
        PSLS in 2023 due to its halt because of the pandemic, 61 student leaders
        from PHINMA-University of Pangasinan, PHINMA-Saint Jude College in
        Manila, PHINMA-Republican College in Quezon City, PHINMA-Rizal College
        of Laguna, PHINMA-Union College of Laguna, PHINMA-Araullo University in
        Nueva Ecija, Southwestern University PHINMA in Cebu City, and
        PHINMA-Cagayan de Oro College along with PHINMA-University of Iloilo in
        Iloilo City attended the three-day itinerary of activities and immersive
        city tour from different places of Iloilo City.<br /><br />The core
        objective of the summit is to instill in the students how to make the
        lives of others better, with activities that heed their active
        participation among peers, it is a must for the student leaders to think
        critically about what they can change and what must change as a group
        and as an individual.<br /><br />In his message, Mr. Chito B. Salazar,
        the Chief Executive Officer of PHINMA Education, emphasized the
        importance of the student and labor force as a key to change. “You need
        to want to change the world in order to change anything.” Mr. Salazar
        said on the first day of the summit.<br /><br />He encouraged student
        leaders to have the serenity to know what they cannot change, the
        courage to know what they can change, and the wisdom to know the
        difference as united students can have a powerful impact on making the
        lives of others better.<br />

      <span class="message"
        >Mr. Christopher A. Tan, the Country Head of PHINMA Education
        Philippines also said in his message that students should help in
        creating good memories so that these memories can persist in the future.
        “The place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and
        the world’s deep hunger meet.” He said, highlighting that student
        leaders should look between the lines so that they will know where the
        structural injustice it and to make a move on improving the lives it
        affected.<br /><br />When asked about his participation in the 5th PSLS,
        Mr. Ricardo V. Terrado Jr., the Vice President of PHINMA-UPang Supreme
        Student Council said that his participation as a student leader of
        PHINMA-UPang revealed the resonance among student leaders functioning
        similarly. “Creating positive pathways, whether on campus or in the
        community, becomes more attainable when aligned with individuals sharing
        identical positions and mindsets, this synergy not only aids in
        achieving goals but also empowers us to aim higher through critical
        thinking in various situations,” he said.<br /><br />Terrado notes that
        the significant lesson he learned from the summit is “Sarili Para sa
        Bayan” where students have the power to change the world collectively
        and be the catalysts for change in our country. His shared desire to
        create a positive change can be manifested in collaborative efforts with
        the other student leaders to drive their mission and vision in taking a
        step forward for themselves and the betterment of of the communities
        they serve. <br /><br />A significant lesson from the 5th PSLS was
        "Sarili Para sa Bayan" - the understanding that each of us has a purpose
        in this world and that collectively, we can be catalysts for change. Our
        shared desire for positive change can be realized through collaborative
        efforts, driving our mission and vision forward for ourselves and the
        communities we serve.<br /><br />With the end of the Summit, a new force
        is created, Innovative and Integrated Student Alliance is created
        through the cultivation of unity among student leaders across the PHINMA
        Education Network from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. IISA members of
        each school have advocacy to uphold and will stir change to make the
        lives of others better. Two student leaders from PHINMA-UPang, Mr.
        Terrado and Mr. Oliver B. Tumang, governor of the College of Engineering
        and Architecture Student Council, each advocate for Social Justice and
        Waste Management respectively while Mr. Robert Louise R. Gabiola, the
        governor of College of Arts and Sciences Student Council, is the
        representative for PHINMA-UPang.<br /><br />As announced, in 2024,
        PHINMA-University of Pangasinan will host the 6th PHINMA Education
        Student Leaders’ Summit and also celebrate its 100th anniversary of the
        university.<br
