        >Let me ask you this:<br />Have you tired to be in our shoes as
        women?<br />Ridiculous as it could sound, but did you notice?<br /><br />I
        hope you thought to yourself like “who said it was simple?”<br /><br />To
        go to school or have a walk around the neighborhood while being called
        names by men twice our age,<br />Regardless of what we wear, most of us
        would surpass while some are captured and locked up in their cage;<br /><br />Who
        said it was simple?<br /><br />To dress as we want and not trying to
        impress the malicious eyes wondering around at night like some prize of
        a game,<br />To text our girl friends when we get home safe and it does
        not occur to us that not all of our guy friends don’t have to do the
        same;<br /><br />Who said it was simple?<br /><br />That we can’t go
        outside without at least bringing a pepper spray,<br />As daughters of
        most men begged us to be careful and then told our brothers to go out
        and play;<br /><br />Who said it was simple?<br /><br />To not be called
        a whiny oversharer as we express our feelings while men expressing
        theirs are considered brave,<br />“Stop overreacting so much” that’s
        what they said as it just echoes in our mind cave;<br /><br />Who said
        it was simple?<br /><br />To tell a boy that I was powerful then told me
        to mind my own business, <br />Wish I could tell them there are pretty
        women wallpapers that aren’t voiceless;<br /><br />To do what men can do
        and make a beautiful art,<br />Yet still being belittled by them as they
        get a head start;<br /><br />To face our monthly pains while trying to
        stay on top,<br />As men laughed at us for being “weak” nonstop;<br /><br />To
        carry a child for nine months while being as strong and stable,<br />Happily
        Married or r@ped ‘cause life’s a gamble; <br /><br />Misogyny,
        insensitive, gaslighting, abusive,<br />It’s not our fault for
        “triggering” those yet why put the blame on us?<br /><br />Don’t tell me
        I can’t get mad, <br />‘cause being a feminist isn’t bad;<br /><br />Don’t
        ask me what’s wrong, <br />For standing up and being strong;<br /><br />Someday
        I just want people to like more than I want to change the city,<br />Yet
        some would tell me to sit still and look pretty;<br /><br />Now let me
        ask you again; who said it was simple being a women?<br />Or rather, not
        all these scenarios are hidden yet have you tried to listen?<br /><br />“Behaving”
        and being “quiet” is what you told us to do,<br />Thus you’re saying
        that silence is not an act of violence too?<br
