          variety of challenging race-track layouts, a 90-minute hot showcase of
          fast reflexes topped with high-octane driving skills, and a
          top-of-the-notch technology fueling the hybrid cars, it is without a
          doubt that Formula 1 is at the top-shelf of motorsports and is
          therefore worthy of global appreciation and attention.</span
        ><span class="teamwork-advancements-entertainment"
          >With its unparalleled technological advancements and intricate
          teamwork between the driver, the pit wall's engineers, and
          strategists, and the garage's mechanics, the race has become a global
          spectacle for spectators looking for an adrenaline-filled sport to
          entertain themselves. <br /> </span
        ><span class="hundred-year-history">A hundred-year-old history</span
        ><span class="evolution-inclusivity-generation"
          >Despite only reaching its peak popularity in the mainstream media in
          recent years, Formula One automobile racing's history can be traced
          back as far as 100 years ago in pre-World War France. Since then, the
          sport has evolved from its race cars with "rudimentary machines,
          simple chassis, and engines that were little more than modified road
          cars" to racing cars powered by hybrid engines and adapted with the
          most recent aerodynamic advancements and sustainable technology.
          <br />
          <br />With its old roots being only formerly associated with the
          upper-class motor enthusiasts and wealthy manufacturers of the 1900s,
          the sport has slowly made its presence more inclusive and accessible
          to everyone regardless of class and status. <br />
          <br />Watching open-wheel racing has become a prominent talking point
          and weekend activity for the newer generations, especially among the
          millennials and members of Generation Z. </span
        ><span class="familiar-sport">A familiar sport</span
        ><span class="filipinos-excitement"
          >Although the sport is a relatively familiar idea, Formula 1 has never
          been a household name for most of the world, even in the Philippines.
          The common Filipinos somehow know single-seat auto racing as an
          established theme in birthday parties, and to some extent, it is
          existent with PSP games, video games, and movies, which shows a little
          more than less excitement than what exactly the race has to offer. </span
        ><span class="grand-prix">The Grand Prix </span
        ><span class="fastest-advanced-motorsport"
          >Formula 1 is the world's fastest and most advanced motorsport, often
          called the "pinnacle of motorsports," where cars race at an asphalt
          track with speeds averaging 220 miles per hour. The sports run on a
          strict and complex implementation of rules and guidelines on-track
          racing, testing, and developments governed and sanctioned by a world
          body called the FIA - Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile.
          <br />
          <br />Basically, it is a battle of quick wits and teamwork. Ten teams
          with two drivers make up the "grid" and compete with each other in an
          open-cockpit professional motor racing contest. An engineer for each
          driver is assigned through the radio to guide and communicate team
          orders during the race. The main goal of each team is to compete with
          their technologically advanced cars and gain as many points as
          possible to win the Constructor's Championship. The 20 race drivers,
          however, subject themselves to a wheel-to-wheel battle to win the
          World Driver's Championship based on an individual performance
          point-grade system.</span
        ><span class="action-packed-weekend">An action-packed weekend</span
        ><span class="race-events-qualifying-sessions"
          >An F1 season comprises several race events, called the Grand Prix,
          held on a 3-day stretch at international circuits around the world,
          most of which are found in major cities in Europe and the Americas.
          <br />
          <br />The 3-day event is divided into three free practice sessions
          held on Friday and Saturday. FP1, FP2, and FP3 last an hour each for
          the team to gather relevant data and optimize the car for the
          Qualifying Sessions, which are scheduled later on Saturdays.
          Qualifying sessions determine the driver's starting grid position for
          Sunday's race by competing to set the fastest complete lap times
          against the clock. The result during QS is detrimental to securing an
          opportunity to win the actual race on Sunday. <br />
          <br />Sprint races are also part of the event. However, it is only
          done at specific circuits and GPs. <br /> </span
        ><span class="high-speed-event">More than a high-speed event</span
        ><span class="complex-data-strategic-management"
          >The misconception that motor racing is nothing but watching cars go
          full-throttle multiple times in a circuit undermines the efforts of
          the people working behind the science of the car's automation and the
          impeccable analysis and proactive strategic management of strategists
          and engineers. True that the star of the event is the cars and their
          pilots, but behind the speed and smoke comes a hotpot of complex data
          and intricate decision-making on devising an optimal plan, may it be
          deciding which type of tires to use or which race strategy should be
          played out, all while securing the team's triumph and the driver's
          safety at hand. <br /> </span
        ><span class="inclusive-environment"
          >Pushing toward a more inclusive environment</span
        ><span class="inclusive-environment-12"
          >Despite several issues relating to misogyny and racism in the pits,
          the sports have been pushing for a more inclusive environment where
          all people, regardless of race, gender, and age, are given an
          opportunity to take part in both the front lines and behind the scenes
          of the sports. <br />
          <br />In recent years, there has been a very visible lack of diversity
          in the motorsports industry. This has been positively and is slowly
          being turned around. Mercedes' driver and seven-time world champion,
          Sir Lewis Hamilton, has been making efforts to voice out and be at the
          forefront of this advocacy. <br />
          <br />In the matter of gender inclusiveness, Susie Wolff, the former
          professional racing driver, has helped establish a laddered
          opportunity pathway for women by leading a female-only racing series
          called the Formula 1 Academy. This allows women to access newer
          opportunities to participate in Formula 1. <br />
          <br />Although no explicit rules prohibit the participation of female
          drivers in Formula 1, there has been a very limited presence and
          opportunity given to women for them to be seen in the F1 grid. As a
          matter of fact, it has been 32 years since a woman last competed in
          Formula One when Giovanna Amati raced in 1992. </span
        ><span class="glorious-season">Cheers to a glorious season</span
        ><span class="glorious-season-13"
          >As Formula 1 continues to evolve as a sport, it would not be
          surprising if the next seasons become more exciting and palpably
          appetizing to watch. Its influence in both automotive engineering and
          design, as well as its genius efforts to be more accessible, will
          surely make a great impact on how the next generation views the
          sport--- a competitive avenue where thrill and fairness transpire.
