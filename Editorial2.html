            <p class="text-wrapper-2">
              Have you heard of Artificial Intelligence (AI)? It’s not really new but there are a few things to look out
              for when encountering AI. Supposedly, AI is being hired/used instead of an actual person.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
              Recently, GMA released the very first AI-generated sportscasters in the Philippines, which shocked and
              angered people. Why hire AI over a person who uses their emotions and shows it in their tone of voice? One
              must realize that AI doesn’t really get tired or sick from speaking but it will only take an input of
              words for this AI to work. Maybe, not that easy but, really, an AI being hired? It’s not really new
              anymore.
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrapper-2">MIA and MARCO: AI-generated Sportscasters</p>
            <p class="mia-and-marco-were">
              Mia and Marco were not the first AI-generated newscasters ever created. The very first official
              AI-generated newscaster is in China where XINHUA State News Agency made it to broadcast news 24/7 that
              comes from the Chinese government.<br /><br />When you look at it, AI can be a ‘perfect’ broadcaster, with
              no stuttering, no breaks, no expensive salary given, only maintenance -- which means it is a very ‘cheap’
              alternative to humans.<br /><br />The realization that we are being replaced by machines should probably
              scare us but what more can we do but accept the future that we, ourselves, created?<br /><br />We are
              seeking innovation, a very new generation leisurely and enjoying our lives that will be easy with this
              technology. Now, where does the line go between innovation and exploitation?<br /><br />GMA also
              emphasizes that MAIA and MARCO are just presenters and are not journalists. They also said that they will
              not replace broadcasters who have vast amounts of experience.
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrapper-2">Bold steps towards the Future</p>
            <p class="AI-is-definitely-a">
              AI is definitely a bold step towards the future, the pros of AI are that it can be used as a tool and make
              a person’s work easy. Generating ideas, for example, can be fast and you can even modify it by adjusting
              just a few things and then done! You now have an idea made by a machine.<br /><br />GMA’s bold choices
              lead to different tones of opinions but mostly, this move is insensitive to those people who pursue media,
              like me. Others always say that in the media, it’s hard to find a job so with these AI-generated
              sportscasters, it basically means our road is not paved that well. They are stuck to calling it
              innovative, but it just sounds like they are cutting off branches and killing a mass communication
              student’s dream to be a journalist in the future.<br /><br />So what is innovation in newscasting? Is it
              replacing humans with their job in it and replacing them with AI-generated newscasters that can process
              hundreds of information at once? Sounds a bit dystopian to me.<br /><br />I understand that we must
              embrace the change, we must embrace the future, but how can I embrace a future where I will never live the
              dream that I have dreamed of?
            </p>
            <div class="text-wrapper-2">A Beginning</div>
            <p class="as-much-as-i-am">
              As much as I am against the use of Artificial Intelligence, it still proves itself useful. Yes, it can be
              used as a tool and generate ideas that I might not think of. Yes, it can point me to something useful and
              yes, it is indeed superior when it comes to efficiency. But it still does not beat the emotions of getting
              a new idea by yourself when you were hopeless for hours, it still does not beat the arts crafted by human
              hands and their emotion, and it does not beat the moment of mistakes that become a meme or an inside joke
              among your co-workers.<br /><br />AI is indeed innovative but at the same time, it is being exploited and
              humans are the ones who end up getting the burn. Instead of that, why don’t we enhance AI and let it help
              us towards our bold step of the future instead of leaving the world of human creation behind?
