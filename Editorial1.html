            <p class="text-wrapper">Age Doesn’t Matter, So Does Your Jail Sentence</p>
            <div class="text-wrapper-2">By Isshael Espiritu</div>
            <p class="text-wrapper-3">&#34;Age doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; they said.</p>
            <p class="however-some-take-it">
              However, some take it too far -- even below the age of consent -- to justify their ‘love’ for each other.
              Other times, they wait for the younger person to turn eighteen as a pass to not get caught in the act.
              Take EJ Laure for example, who only admitted to the rumors on her involvement with Bugoy Carino, as well
              as the pregnancy, as soon as he turned 18 in 2020.<br /><br />Well-known couples with grooming include
              Julia Montes and Coco Martin, who went public with their relationship in 2023, stating that he tried to
              court Julia when she was 13, he was 25. I can certainly go on and on about more cases, but one thing
              remains: It’s all about how the media somehow normalized grooming.<br /><br />According to CNN Philippines
              in a September 2023 article, the Philippines ranked second in online sexual abuse and exploitation of
              children.
            </p>
            <div class="text-wrapper-3">What is grooming?</div>
            <p class="according-to-the">
              According to the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MCASA), grooming is an act of  exploitation
              where a child sexual offender takes advantage of the younger individual, a minor, for sexual favors while
              maintaining secrecy. They even go as far as obtaining parental consent by gaining their trust and share a
              pattern of targeting victims, often vulnerable young kids.<br /><br />Perpetrators deny allegations and
              often cloak it in lots of excuses such as &#39;love&#39;. Some even claim that they are just
              &#39;helping&#39; these children with their problems, reinforcing some sort of savior complex in their
              head.
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrapper-3">How did the media manage to normalize grooming?</p>
            <p class="the-media-as-we-all">
              The media, as we all know, is one of the forerunners in shaping society for the better or worse. They
              provide platforms for the general public, especially public figures like celebrities.<br /><br />The love
              team culture has introduced us to pairs like Liza Soberano and Enrique Gil, also known as LizQuen, who
              starred in shows like Dolce Amore. Soberano was 17 at the time she dated Gil, and no one seemed to bat an
              eye. Elvis Presley married ex-wife Priscilla when she was 21, he was 32 but met her at 14. <br /><br />No
              calls for accountability were ever made until years later. Soap operas have long conditioned society to
              believe in the notion that love knows no age nor boundaries.<br /><br />It’s true, but it only applies to
              adults. Not a minor and an adult.<br /><br />Love stories have told us it’s fine to go after an older
              person or entertain one, thinking it’s fine without any repercussions. They veil it under the guise of
              ‘maturity’. To them, it’s a perfectly normal romance, almost as normal as every teenage Wattpad
              novel-turned-movie.<br /><br />Apart from this, you get romantic tropes shown in lots of media where they
              emphasize ‘the right time’ and purely waiting for your love. This only applies to couples with no
              questionable age gaps and a valid reason to wait — not waiting for the time where they won’t consider
              themselves prisoners. Sweetie, even if he says he’s waiting for you to turn 18 before you two can make it
              official, you better run. That does not make anything better.
            </p>
            <div class="text-wrapper-3">Why is it wrong?</div>
            <p class="first-and-foremost">
              First and foremost, it&#39;s literally a form of exploitation and involves children. Even if one tries to
              excuse it by saying that minor and adult romantic relationships don’t necessarily involve grooming, it is
              still downright inappropriate to actively pursue a 13-year-old freshly out of elementary school or
              entertain people under 18 who confess having romantic feelings for you. No, it is your obligation as an
              adult to protect the wellbeing of a child, not exploit them by reciprocating their feelings.<br /><br />“My
              parents were 25 and 41 when they got married!” Honey, your parents met when they were adults with computer
              science degrees and employment.<br /><br />Moreover, waiting for them to turn 18 isn’t morally correct,
              either. You are only looking for a free ticket out of jail and a facade to make your relationship seem
              legal. No one can just say that it’s the same person when they are both in different ages – there never
              was any reason, at all, to justify acts like this.<br />“Oh, she’s in the age of consent,” The age of
              consent is literally 16, only signed in 2022 from the previous 12 years old. That’s still lower than 18,
              barely an adult and hasn’t seen 18 roses at her debut.<br />You’re just taking advantage of youth and
              twisting the truth in your favor, the same way you take advantage of how the media feeds you the wrong
              information if you are not careful enough.
