                            It seems that most people simply cannot survive without ever having something (or someone) to look up to:
                            whether it be the presence of loved ones, life events made to be a driving force to work hard and be
                            glorified by others later, and successes that we yearn for and would lift up to the heavens once we
                            receive them.<br /><br />We grow up to believe that we were put in this earth as a gift—to our direct
                            families, our friends, and the society we grow up around. A gift given by a supreme being, with talents
                            that we display that sets us apart from the rest.<br /><br />But this is far from the huge mass of land,
                            sky, and sea that was made in 6 days. Far from a world whose blueprint should supposedly be from a thick
                            book made by unknown scriptwriters from centuries past.<br /><br />For we must remember that we were born
                            with the ability to express.<br />But unfortunately, it is for this reason that one of us has been falsely
                            incarcerated.

                        <p class="text-wrapper-3">
                            In July of 2023, Amadeus Fernando Pagente, a drag performer more popularly known as Pura Luka Vega,
                            performed a rock remix of “Ama Namin” at an improvised bar in Quezon City, in which clips of the
                            performance quickly went viral. Orders for “persona non grata” (a title for someone who is unwelcome in a
                            particular area) quickly came in for the artist from almost 20 different localities. And in October 4 that
                            same year, they were arrested in Manila after being accused of blasphemy, but was eventually released on
                            October 7th, 2023 after posting bail amounting to ₱72,000.

                            <span class="span">Here are things I’ve conceptualized about this for the longest time:<br /><br /></span>
                            <span class="text-wrapper-5">Religion is a choice</span>
                            <span class="span">
                                - we were born with it, but did we even want to be surrounded by such a concept? Our family and friends
                                have been enough to support and shape us. Not some deity we still fail to prove existed centuries ago.
                                So with that being said, one can be free to abandon that religion once they find themselves capable of
                                choosing for themselves.<br /><br
                            /></span>
                            <span class="text-wrapper-5">Religion is merely a concept</span>

                                - as I just said. Something we cannot see seems to know everything before it even happens. Yet, we are
                                also told that with hard work, perseverance, and a fortunate twist of fate will lead us to anywhere we
                                ought to be. Coincidences and day-to-day circumstances are more real than thy word made flesh.<br /><br

                            <span class="span">
                                - whoever said that we should be joined together through the grace of god when there are clearly things
                                that are meant to be separated? Things such as people in deteriorating relationships, people who
                                identify beyond the godly definition of man and woman and only seek to be where their truly heart is,
                                and those whose beliefs are not necessarily needed in a particular situation, like in the case of Pura
                                Luka Vega.<br /><br
                            /></span>

                                - When we were infants, we only knew how to cry, make messes, break things more than fix them. But no
                                one ever really condemned us for even the slightest mistake, because we were simply “children.” If
                                religious people claim that everyone is a “child of god”, then wouldn’t the father be quite please with
                                a child’s version of his teachings, knowing that he has known it by heart and is using his talents to
                                spread that joy in the way they know best?</span

                        <p class="contrary-to-common">
                            Contrary to common conservative beliefs, there is an acknowledged church worldwide that recognizes and
                            celebrates the existence of LGBTQIA+ people who choose to maintain their faith in God without having to
                            compromise their identity. In fact, there is a branch in the Philippines, the Open Table Metropolitan
                            Community Church located in San Juan City. And in an article written and published by the church’s head
                            pastor, Reverend Joseph Tiu-San Jose, he gives his take on the Pura Luka Vega issue that has sparked my
                            interest, and might even bewilder some others.<br /><br />An excerpt from this article, entitled, “Jesus
                            in Drag and Lip-Syncing” notes, “Let us be careful who and what we label as blasphemous or a heretic. We
                            are all blasphemers and heretics from someone’s point of view no matter how devout we are. Jesus himself
                            was nailed to the cross both as a rebel against the empire and as a blasphemer who offended religious
                            feelings and practices…<br /><br />…If Jesus is who Jesus is I don’t think he will be offended by some gay
                            [guys] having fun in a bar lip-syncing the Lord’s prayer by a drag performer in a drag Jesus outfit and
                            makeup more than the election of someone whose family plundered an entire nation and killed thousands of
                            people who called them into account. Jesus would be more offended with bishops, priests, and Christian
                            pastors who are silent with injustices and killings but who are hell-bent and will spend all effort and
                            resources to continue the discrimination of LGBTQIA+ people.<br />Jesus would feel insulted with
                            Christians praying in his name but do not care nor think about the pain, oppression, and suffering around
                            them.” (https://opentablemcc.ph/blog/jesus-in-drag-and-lip-syncing/)

                            Yes, my word is not law—it never was. My opinion platform is simply a privilege given to me to take charge
                            of the way I so desire. After all, this exact concept is the very essence of what an opinion is.<br /><br />Yes,
                            I am not like Jesus who was able to turn water into wine or walk on the raging sea, but I know that like
                            him, I, too have a voice. And I am determined to use it.<br /><br />But to me, I know I seem to be in an
                            image like his—someone put in this earth knowing that I can never please everyone, and has no intention of
                            doing so. I know where I stand—in a world where one day, a coliseum might be built for me to speak my own
                            version of the truth, and the next, I might be put back before the audience to be stoned to death.<br /><br />But
                            with everything said and done, and if it might come down to this, then so be it. I would gladly be a
                            martyr for the truth.<br /><br />And it would be my greatest honor.
