                            Reaching for one’s greatness is innate in every living individual in this world. Aspiring for a certain
                            goal makes a human as human as possible. Powered by desires, wants, and dreams, we bask in this sun and
                            dedicate to live each day in pursuit of success hoping that someday we can make our parents, the people
                            who brought us into this world, feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for their young.

                            Reaching for greatness as a gift for parents have always been etched in the minds and hearts of every
                            person who has ever experience being a kid. Doing good and seeing a smile, hoping to hear the word
                            “Congratulations”, is something that we all somehow craved for growing up. <br /><br />Some people
                            however, never learned to make themselves grow around the applause of others, more often than not, they
                            tend to live for it and as sad of a thought as it can be, it is even sadder to think that the reason they
                            subject themselves into too much pressure is because it is put onto them by the very people who should be
                            their vessel for support.

                                people in this world embarks too hard on something they don’t enjoy but continue to do so because they
                                are subjected to it? How many burn-out students continue to try too much because of unsettling high
                                expectations from their elders? Surely, we don’t know the exact numbers, but how many times have we
                                heard the same stories? How many times have we seen this plot on telenovelas and movies? Many times. At
                                this point, it could even be a generational curse passed down to us. A folklore of some sort. People put
                                themselves into heavy ordeals and try to achieve academic feats for the sake of compliance but often
                                never because they wanted to. As a result, they lose themselves and their self-identity trying to gain
                                something they never wanted in the first place. <br /><br

                                to achieve more than they can take is because of money. As a country with limited and top-of-the-notch
                                requirements to get working opportunities, graduating with a good academic background backing you up is
                                a key to escaping poverty and establishing a good life. In a sense, pushing kids to achieve greatly is
                                somehow translatable to securing them a good life. Although usually well-intentioned, pushing them over
                                the top to the point of scarring them for life, is never a reasonable excuse.<br

                        <p class="strict-parents-often">
                            Strict parents often argue that putting pressure on kids is necessary to keep them working and aspiring
                            for the best. “Diamonds are made under pressure,” they say. But is pressure really necessary? Do we have
                            to put our offsprings in a situation where they question themselves and their abilities when goals are
                            unmet? Or would it be possible to choose to support them with positive reinforcements and moral
                            affirmations to keep them grounded and sane? <br /><br />Checking on your kid’s academic welfare every now
                            and then and making sure they’re doing alright is great. However, being too uptight on their academics
                            often do more bad than good. It takes a toll on the children’s mental health and might manifest into more
                            serious issues. This is backed by a study conducted by Howard et al. (2019) where he investigated the
                            linkages between authoritative parenting and academic success. Results showed that “parents who engage in
                            overparenting, such as restricting autonomy and intrusiveness negatively impacted their students’ success
                            in college. It interferes with the child&#39;s ability to develop a sense of autonomy or competence. It
                            may undermine a child’s ability to take full credit for their accomplishments, resulting in lower
                            self-esteem.”<br /><br />However, on a separate study conducted by Steinberg (1989) and Dehart (2004), it
                            is stated that “Children who described their parents as treating them warmly, democratically, and firmly
                            were more likely than their peers to develop positive attitudes and beliefs about their self-esteem,
                            self-concept, and achievement. Consequently, these children are more likely to do better in school.”

                        <p class="text-wrapper-3">Burning with passion or just burn-out?</p>
                        <p class="it-is-without-a">
                            It is without a doubt that a parent’s tender nourishment and comforting words nurtures a child to become a
                            perfectly molded adult. It is understandable that parents only want the best for their kids. Still,
                            sometimes we must let the children find their way to their dreams so they can become an accomplished adult
                            without the emotional baggage of misplaced pressure that would burden their lives. <br /><br />We can
                            either have child burning with passion, success, and a light heart for what they want or a burn-out kid
                            living a successful life with nothing but a heavy heart.
