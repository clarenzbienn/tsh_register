          playing it.</span
        ><span class="basketball-in-the-philippines"
          >Basketball has been a prominent sport in the Philippines, dating back
          to when the Americans had snatched the ownership of the country from
          the hands of the Spaniards, it is meant to be a lasting impression of
          the colonialism that happened in the country. Basketball is not really
          associated with the dark side of history rather it is associated with
          the interesting and easy mechanics it brought. Even now, Basketball is
          still the most popular sport in the Philippines.<br />
          <br />Out of nowhere, and just recently, The Filipinas, a Filipino
          Football team, won the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup last July 25, 2023.
          The one who is behind the historic goal was Sarina Bolden, a
          half-Pangasinense and African American descent. <br /><br />For 90
          minutes of holding down their defense, Bolden assured their win when
          the goalkeeper lost her grip on the ball and Bolden made that historic
          score against New Zealand’s Football Fern. <br /><br />This win,
          however, stirred a thought about whether football does fit Filipinos
          instead of Basketball.</span
        ><span class="infrastructure-and-equipment"
          >Infrastructure and Equipment</span
        ><span class="basketball-vs-football-infrastructure"
          >For Basketball, people even use make shift basketball rings and an
          overused ball. On every street, there would be a ring that signifies
          the Filipinos' love for basketball even if all the equipments are
          makeshift. Even Sangguniang Kabataan will propose a program of
          Basketball Liga where teenagers from their barangay can play and
          compete in Basketball. To make sports popular, a basic infrastructure
          is needed for it to be even playable, that is why Basketball is famous
          because the government can even fund the instruction and equipment.
          <br />
          <br />For Football, it can be a bit expensive for that matter, a wide
          field is needed to play but you only need a ball to kick. Rice fields
          that were freshly trimmed off the harvest could even be a playing
          field. No need for a ring that would cost much to maintain.</span
        ><span class="mechanics-and-rules">Mechanics and Rules</span
        ><span class="football-vs-basketball-mechanics"
          >In Football, the only thing a player should keep in their mind is do
          not let the ball out of their sight (or foot), do not let other
          players snatch it away, and do not hit them either then run towards
          their goal. In Basketball, a player will also not let the ball out of
          their sight but keep sight of their own teammate and the other team so
          that they could make a pass towardsb their player because if the ball
          lasts for long in their hand. Players need to be quick and have fast
          decision making skills so they do not gain any fouls for handling the
          ball wrong.</span
        ><span class="advantages-and-disadvantages"
          >Advantages and disadvantages</span
        ><span class="basketball-vs-football-advantages"
          >In Basketball, being taller is a great advantage, that is why a lot
          of players will be roughly 200cm (6’7) tall. The average height of a
          person in the Philippines has the average height as roughly 164cm
          (5’5), unless the player is witty enough to get the other’s hand away
          from the ball, which is impossible proximity. Going against a 200cm
          tall player, will probably not gain you an advantage. In Football,
          height does not matter as long as they are quick on their feet and can
          run away from the players who will snatch away the ball.</span
        ><span class="famous-filipino-players">Famous Filipino Players</span
        ><span class="historic-mark-football"
          >Recently, Sarina Bolden made a historic mark in Football. Winning the
          2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup in New Zealand. Even though on July 30,
          2023, they lost against Norway with a points of 6-0, their win in New
          Zealand still left a lasting impression on the history of Football in
          the country. <br />
          <br />Bolden is definitely a significant player of Filipino descent,
          while in Basketball, sometimes people lose count of famous players who
          are winning and gaining recognition in International
          competitions.</span
        ><span class="fun-times-memories">For fun times and memories</span
        ><span class="sports-philippines"
          >It's very important to note that people will treat different sports
          differently, someone will think that Football is easy while still
          thinking that Basketball cannot be changed as one of the famous sports
          in the Philippines and someone will think that Football should have
          been the sports of the country because of how overrated Basketball is.
          <br />
          <br />Filipinos love their sports, they love their players and they
          love playing it. They will never change their mind over the feelings
          and experiences they get whenever they play Basketball, it has been a
          long tradition and past timenfor Filipinos that it does not matter if
          Filipinos can be good at other sports. There are still significant
          Filipinos who will strive to be the best players in their chosen
          sports and people should still remind themselves, that it’s fine that
          there are differences in their love for sports, as long as they enjoy
          it, people will experience fun times and create memories.</span
