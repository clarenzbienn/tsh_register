                >It seems that most people simply cannot survive without ever having
                something (or someone) to look up to: whether it be the presence of
                loved ones, life events made to be a driving force to work hard and be
                glorified by others later, and successes that we yearn for and would
                lift up to the heavens once we receive them.<br /><br />We grow up to
                believe that we were put in this earth as a gift—to our direct
                families, our friends, and the society we grow up around. A gift given
                by a supreme being, with talents that we display that sets us apart
                from the rest.<br /><br />But this is far from the huge mass of land,
                sky, and sea that was made in 6 days. Far from a world whose blueprint
                should supposedly be from a thick book made by unknown scriptwriters
                from centuries past.<br /><br />For we must remember that we were born
                with the ability to express.<br />But unfortunately, it is for this
                reason that one of us has been falsely incarcerated.<br /></span

                >In July of 2023, Amadeus Fernando Pagente, a drag performer more
                popularly known as Pura Luka Vega, performed a rock remix of “Ama
                Namin” at an improvised bar in Quezon City, in which clips of the
                performance quickly went viral. Orders for “persona non grata” (a
                title for someone who is unwelcome in a particular area) quickly came
                in for the artist from almost 20 different localities. And in October
                4 that same year, they were arrested in Manila after being accused of
                blasphemy, but was eventually released on October 7th, 2023 after
                posting bail amounting to ₱72,000.<br /></span

                  - we were born with it, but did we even want to be surrounded by
                  such a concept? Our family and friends have been enough to support
                  and shape us. Not some deity we still fail to prove existed
                  centuries ago. So with that being said, one can be free to abandon
                  that religion once they find themselves capable of choosing for
                  themselves.<br /><br /></span

                  - as I just said. Something we cannot see seems to know everything
                  before it even happens. Yet, we are also told that with hard work,
                  perseverance, and a fortunate twist of fate will lead us to anywhere
                  we ought to be. Coincidences and day-to-day circumstances are more
                  real than thy word made flesh.<br /><br /></span

                  of god when there are clearly things that are meant to be separated?
                  Things such as people in deteriorating relationships, people who
                  identify beyond the godly definition of man and woman and only seek
                  to be where their truly heart is, and those whose beliefs are not
                  necessarily needed in a particular situation, like in the case of
                  Pura Luka Vega.<br /><br /></span

                  - When we were infants, we only knew how to cry, make messes, break
                  things more than fix them. But no one ever really condemned us for
                  even the slightest mistake, because we were simply “children.” If
                  religious people claim that everyone is a “child of god”, then
                  wouldn’t the father be quite please with a child’s version of his
                  teachings, knowing that he has known it by heart and is using his
                  talents to spread that joy in the way they know best?</span

                >Contrary to common conservative beliefs, there is an acknowledged
                church worldwide that recognizes and celebrates the existence of
                LGBTQIA+ people who choose to maintain their faith in God without
                having to compromise their identity. In fact, there is a branch in the
                Philippines, the Open Table Metropolitan Community Church located in
                San Juan City. And in an article written and published by the church’s
                head pastor, Reverend Joseph Tiu-San Jose, he gives his take on the
                Pura Luka Vega issue that has sparked my interest, and might even
                bewilder some others.<br /><br />An excerpt from this article,
                entitled, “Jesus in Drag and Lip-Syncing” notes, “Let us be careful
                who and what we label as blasphemous or a heretic. We are all
                blasphemers and heretics from someone’s point of view no matter how
                devout we are. Jesus himself was nailed to the cross both as a rebel
                against the empire and as a blasphemer who offended religious feelings
                and practices…<br /><br />…If Jesus is who Jesus is I don’t think he
                will be offended by some gay [guys] having fun in a bar lip-syncing
                the Lord’s prayer by a drag performer in a drag Jesus outfit and
                makeup more than the election of someone whose family plundered an
                entire nation and killed thousands of people who called them into
                account. Jesus would be more offended with bishops, priests, and
                Christian pastors who are silent with injustices and killings but who
                are hell-bent and will spend all effort and resources to continue the
                discrimination of LGBTQIA+ people.<br />Jesus would feel insulted with
                Christians praying in his name but do not care nor think about the
                pain, oppression, and suffering around them.”

                privilege given to me to take charge of the way I so desire. After
                all, this exact concept is the very essence of what an opinion is.<br /><br />Yes,
                I am not like Jesus who was able to turn water into wine or walk on
                the raging sea, but I know that like him, I, too have a voice. And I
                am determined to use it.<br /><br />But to me, I know I seem to be in
                an image like his—someone put in this earth knowing that I can never
                please everyone, and has no intention of doing so. I know where I
                stand—in a world where one day, a coliseum might be built for me to
                speak my own version of the truth, and the next, I might be put back
                before the audience to be stoned to death.<br /><br />But with
                everything said and done, and if it might come down to this, then so
                be it. I would gladly be a martyr for the truth.<br /><br />And it
                would be my greatest honor.<br
