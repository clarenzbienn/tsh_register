              >To be a writer, one must have both the passion and courage of a great
              artist. One must be passionate enough to express one’s thoughts through
              his or her own words and brave enough to speak the truth with their
              works. But what is an artist without its art?</span
            ><span class="writer-mind"
              >An artwork is a mirror of the artist’s mind. Journalists, authors, and
              novelists are all writers and for me, one thing that we all have in
              common aside from using our words as a paintbrush; we writers suffer
              from “writer's block”.  Every great warrior uses weapons; we writers
              weaponize our minds and words as our swords—like every warrior, we also
              have our battles. A very bloody battle every writer fights.<br /><br />Writer’s
              block is a challenge every writer faces. A feeling of losing track of
              how and what can you write for your next masterpiece. Writer’s block is
              pure frustration and disappointment, and every writer has their own
              solutions to overcome it. I, myself, also encounter writer’s block and I
              too have my own way of overcoming it.<br /><br />
              What works for me is that I tend to look for new inspirations and fresh
              motivation as writer’s block makes me feel detached from my passion for
              writing. To eventually help myself regain the spark in me in terms of
              writing: I do recreational activities, get in line with some co-writers,
              and spend generous amounts of time reading other’s works. The writing
              community is very small yet so vast in imagination, I’ve seen and met
              tons of great writers and I always ask them what are their ways to beat
              writer’s block. Some say giving their selves time to relax, others
              answer: fully focusing and sometimes even pressuring themselves to bring
              out the best in themselves—which is all good as long as it works out for
              them, every writer has their style and technique; that is what makes
              one’s work worth reading.<br /><br />These are tons of things that could
              help us defeat mental block, and so, my fellow writers, don’t lose hope
              with a mere writer’s block. Remind yourself that writer’s block is
              nothing but a challenge and once you succeed in overcoming it, you
              become another and a more improved version of yourself, perceiving it as
              an obstacle for you to face to level up and toughen the writer in
              you.<br
