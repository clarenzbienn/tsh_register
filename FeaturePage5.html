              >In a bustling market, on a young Saturday evening, Juan dela Cruz
              fought his way towards the swarm of people in front of a sari-sari
              store. Dust covered his feet and slippers, as he had just finished
              working in a construction site. Counting the remaining change from
              buying the items on his good wife’s list, his face lifted when only one
              was left: a kilogram of rice. As he made his way through, he looked at
              the variety of rice and scanned for the lowest-priced one that could fit
              in what remains of his daily wage clinking in his pocket. Juan dela
              Cruz’s face grew weary and the continuous rise in the price of these
              white grains, for times he could not count, bore extra weight on his
              shoulder. He could not do anything, so he bought half a kilogram and
              headed home.</span
            ><span class="rice-importance"
              >Juan dela Cruz’s story seems to be literally every Filipino’s story
              now. <br /><br />
              Rice is a staple food in a Filipino family’s dining table. Almost every
              meal, rice is always served and paired with different dishes. According
              to the National Nutrition Council (2020), rice has both cultural and
              nutritional importance to Filipinos. It is associated with traditions
              and practices rooted deep into the national identity. It also provides
              half the calorie requirements and other essential nutrients needed
              daily. As an agricultural country whose diet relies upon this crop, an
              increase, even just a couple of pesos, can greatly affect the budget –
              especially of the average and those in and below the poverty line.
              <br /><br />
              In a report of Cariaso (2023), for One News, there has only been
              increase in the price of rice since April of this year. The lowest that
              could be bought in the market is at forty pesos (Php 40.00) and in Metro
              Manila, it can spike up to forty-six pesos (Php 46.00). The causes are
              intertwining but reports revealed that rice is sold at an extremely low
              farmgate price. There are laws implemented by the government aiming to
              improve food security, such as the Republic Act No. 11203 or the Rice
              <br /><br />Liberalization Law, but it has failed to tame the increasing
              price. IBON Foundation (2023) expressed their sentiments regarding the
              law as only putting threat to the local farmers and aggravating
              dependence of the country in importing rice. <br /><br />
              The rise in the price of Filipino’s staple food is more than just losing
              capability of buying enough to last for a day. It is a constant source
              of worry and anxiousness of not having something to feed the family. It
              means doing extended hours of work and taking on extra jobs to cope up
              with the ever-increasing price. Yet, most certainly, every Juan dela
              Cruz, still holds on tight to the hope of a quality and affordable rice
              for the country.<br /><br />
