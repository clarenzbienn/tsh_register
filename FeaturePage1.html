              started to dim and finally, your mom called you to wash up and eat the
              dinner that she prepared. She opened  the television and the theme of 24
              oras started echoing around the room. I remember asking my mom if Mike
              Enriquez and Mel Tiangco were married. As a response, she laughed
              hysterically.. What a childhood.</span

              >We all grew up watching Mike Enriquez, he has been a news anchor for 24
              oras for almost two decades. He is a well-respected broadcaster known
              for his unique voice and his iconic lines “Excuse me po!” and “Di namin
              kayo tatantanan!”. I used to imitate his remarkable  lines when I was
              playing with my friends. He was part of my life for as long as I can
              remember. However, after a long battle with cancer, he passed away at
              age 71. <br /><br />I remember watching Mel Tiangco delivering the news
              of Mike Enriquez’s death on the evening of August 29th. I felt all the
              emotions coming through my body and I remember my childhood days where
              everything was bright and colorful. It was like saying goodbye to a
              family member. Yet, I remembered Mike Enriquez will forever be in our
              hearts. <br /><br />Mike Enriquez , whose real name is Miguel Enriquez
              was born on September 29, 1951 at Santa Ana, Manila. He is the oldest of
              the three siblings. Surprisingly, Mike Enriquez didn’t even plan on
              entering the world of broadcasting and dreamt of becoming a priest
              instead. According to one of his interviews, he idolizes St. Francis of
              Assisi, the same saint whose Pope Francis I is named after.<br /><br />Mike
              Enriquez’s broadcasting career started in 1969 at age 19, his friend
              jokingly introduced him as an expected applicant, he later was asked to
              try since he has nothing to lose and later became a DJ for Manila
              Broadcasting Company. He became known for his pseudonyms “Baby Mike” and
              “Baby Michael”. He even had a cameo role in Andrew E’s 1992 movie
              Mahirap Maging Pogi as a Disc Jockey using his name baby mike.
              <br /><br />Through broadcasting, Mike Enriquez met his wife, Lilybeth
              “Baby” Yumping” and got married in 1977. They had no children and
              adopted their dogs named Booma and Mickey, both were Mike’s
              nicknames.<br /><br />Mike Enriquez became part of GMA in 1994 to head
              its radio division and even expanded it from only four stations at the
              time. Just like his broadcasting career, his TV career started when he
              least expected it. GMA network convinced Mike to be the anchor of the
              1995 Philippine Senatorial Elections coverage. After that he was once
              again invited by the network to do a 15-minute newscast along with Karen
              Davila. Afterwards, he became part of multiple TV programs but is most
              notable for Imbestigador that earned him the nickname “Imbestigador ng
              Bayan” and became part of 24 oras since 2004.<br /><br />At first, Mike
              Enriquez gives an impression of aggressive yet according to his
              co-workers he was far from his “imbestigador” persona. According to
              Marissa L. Flores, the former senior vice president of GMA Public News
              and Affairs,Mike  is a quirky anchor and sometimes there's news that has
              music in it and he’ll act like he’s playing a violin. She even added
              that his quirkiness is beneath him and it can only be seen by the people
              off camera.<br /><br />Another interesting fact, his tagline “excuse me
              po!” is because of his frequent eating of nuts, according to Jessica
              Soho. She also investigated who his supplier was and sometimes they
              would argue because of it. Soho also added that he even joked how many
              times he should cough and he’ll add it on (the conditions) of his
              contract. <br /><br />Mike was known for his dedication to his work. Ahl
              Villanueva, the production assistant for Imbestigador recalled that even
              if Mike is sick, he’ll still go to work. He also shared that one time he
              was scolded because he didn’t text him to do a voice over because he is
              concerned with his health but Mike Enriquez said “I’ll tell you if I
              can’t (go to work). Flores recalled that Mike was the epitome of “Mr.
              News” because he liked news. She remembered that when the staff at the
              newsroom were in a frenzy because there was breaking news that needed to
              be delivered, he was in the middle and was ecstatic because he was so
              excited about the news.<br /><br />His dedication to newscasting made
              him become one of the most prominent figures of television. Aside from
              his love for his profession, he’s also a well-respected man off-cam.
              Many of his workmates expressed their gratitude for Mike Enriquez for
              his kind and sweet nature. <br /><br />Without Mike Enriquez, perhaps
              the lives of millions of Filipinos who grew up watching him will never
              be the same. However, his existence will never be forgotten. I’ll always
              admire how he didn’t fear any political figures and roasted them on
              national television during the 2022 Presidential Election. I remember
              his iconic lines. I remember how he shaped my childhood. Mike Enriquez’s
              unique tone will always be in my heart.<br /></span
