                >For black people, "n*gga" is used as a term of endearment to
                recognize one as a friend or a "buddy". It is an adaption of the word
                "nigger", a Latin term for black people, inevitably the Africans,
                which was attached to the African slave trade in 1619, where Africans
                were sold as slaves mainly for the Americans, stripping their human
                rights off by treating them as no less than animals. The attachment of
                the word to this blood-soaked history seems to be under the shade of
                racial slur being treated as a surface level profanity. Evident to
                people, particularly the young, using the word often without any
                knowledge of the context behind this word.</span

              ><span class="not-black-usage"
                >It's simple; if you're not black, you shouldn't have a say about when
                or how to use the n-word. It's racist. Putting the focus on the
                etymology on the n-word, the black community had indeed, revived the
                slur and used the adapted word as a form of endearment. However, it
                does not give us, non-black people, the permission to use the term AT
                ALL. The reclaim does not change the history the word holds for their
                community. Moreover, the frequent use of the word in general as a
                provocative term, does not desensitize its naturally offensive
                connotation, hence the continuous backlash for its use.  It is our
                responsibility to educate ourselves on these matters, especially when
                issues like these have been anchoring our progress in fostering a safe
                and inclusive society since time immemorial.</span

              ><span class="high-school-student"
                >I once asked a high school student (intentionally as he takes part of
                the highest exposure of false media in the spectrum) if he thinks
                people who say the n-word must face a consequence. His answer was "No,
                tapos na ang slavery ng black people matagal na so bakit kailangan mag
                suffer nang mga taong nag sasabi ng n-word ngayon? Lagi namang
                naririnig sa mga kanta." If you're struck, that makes two of us. Let's
                look at the facts.<br /><br />In an exclusive cover of CNN Africa in
                2017, they discovered slave auctions of Africans in Libya. Further
                information from news articles in 2017 states that 71% of migrants
                experience slavery, particular races mentioned were Eritreans, Somalis
                and Nigerians. Therefore no, black slavery is not completely
                eliminated in the modern world. <br /><br />Slavery is not over,
                racism is not over. But say they are, the weight this word carry will
                never be lessened by any ounce. Black people cannot get over of the
                blood-soaked past because the world never allowed them to, and this is
                manifested in the modern day slavery, the use of n-word by the
                non-black people, and the general amount of disproportionate oblivion
                of the people of the mere facts such as the marginalization, and
                stagnant position of black people in the socio-economic ladder.<br /></span
              ><span class="you-hang-up">You Hang Up</span
              ><span class="fast-paced-trends"
                >The world of trends is so fast paced, "hypes" change from one minute
                to another. And while it is part of our human nature to seek
                dominance, accentuated in this generation as being seen "cool", you as
                a tech-savvy, and well rounded digital native must hang up to the call
                of this sense of "coolness" in using the n-word or literally any word
                that holds power in situating people or a community in harm or
                disgrace. Acknowledge that a "trend" in its own avenue can make you
                believe that because people does it, it's not wrong. It's high time we
                invest our attention to research on social issues as we are at the
                peak of information availability, there is no excuse to justify one's
                unawareness. The recurring issue of the use of the n-word is one of
                the most talked about topics through the years; history, articles, and
                other media resources are available. What else do we need?</span
