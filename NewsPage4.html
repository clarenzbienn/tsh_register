        >The PHINMA University of Pangasinan took a significant stride towards
        fostering leadership and civic engagement among youth by hosting its
        first ever MLOB Gabay-Lakbay event on October 9, 2023, at the university
        gymnasium. The program aims to provide guidance and support to aspiring
        Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) candidates in the upcoming elections.</span
      ><span class="sk-candidates-program"
        >The MLOB Gabay Lakbay program brought together over 300 aspiring SK
        candidates from various colleges and programs within the University of
        Pangasinan. The program was carefully designed to provide participants
        with insights into effective leadership, community development, and the
        responsibilities that come with public service.<br /><br />
        The event kicked off with an inspiring opening ceremony featuring Mr.
        Adele Traspe. He emphasized the meaning of the program “Making the Lives
        of Others Better” and the importance of youth involvement in shaping the
        future of their own respective barangays.<br /><br />
        The University of Pangasinan’s gymnasium was transformed into a hub of
        learning and inspiration as participants actively participated in
        team-building activities, group discussions, and hands-on exercises
        aimed at honing their leadership abilities. Topics covered included good
        governance, ethical leadership, and the legal aspects of being an SK
        official.<br /><br />
        A notable aspect of the MLOB Gabay-Lakbay was the active participation
        of the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV). Their
        involvement added a layer of civic responsibility and electoral
        awareness to the event. PPCRV representatives conducted sessions on the
        importance of fair and transparent elections, encouraging the aspiring
        SK candidates to uphold the principles of integrity and good
        governance.<br /><br />
        Father Hernan Caronongan, delivering the second talk for the program,
        took the opportunity to remind the participants of their responsibility
        towards their communities. He urged them to embody the change they
        wished to see in society.<br /><br />
        The highlight of the event was the closing message delivered by
        Archbishop Socrates Villegas, a revered figure in the community. He
        underscored the sacred nature of serving the community with honesty and
        sincerity, proclaiming, "Ang paglilingkod sa bayan nang tapat at totoo
        ay paglilingkod sa Diyos" (Serving the nation with honesty and truth is
        serving God).<br /><br />
        Following the sessions and workshops, an open forum provided a platform
        for participants to engage with the speakers, ask questions, and share
        their insights. This interactive segment allowed for a dynamic exchange
        of ideas, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among the
        aspiring SK candidates.<br /><br />
        As the event concluded, participants were encouraged to apply the
        knowledge gained from the MLOB Gabay-Lakbay in their communities and to
        actively pursue their aspirations of becoming SK leaders. The program is
        a testament to UPang’s commitment to youth empowerment and community
        development, and dedication to molding lleaders with a deep sense of
        civic duty and spiritual integrity.<br
