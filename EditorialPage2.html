                >By Jasmine Bernadette Bembo</span
              ><span class="artificial-intelligence-encounter"
                >Have you heard of Artificial Intelligence (AI)? It’s not really new
                but there are a few things to look out for when encountering AI.
                Supposedly, AI is being hired/used instead of an actual person.</span
              ><span class="ai-sportscasters-reaction"
                >Recently, GMA released the very first AI-generated sportscasters in
                the Philippines, which shocked and angered people. Why hire AI over a
                person who uses their emotions and shows it in their tone of voice?
                One must realize that AI doesn’t really get tired or sick from
                speaking but it will only take an input of words for this AI to work.
                Maybe, not that easy but, really, an AI being hired? It’s not really
                new anymore.</span
              ><span class="mia-marco-sportscasters"
                >MIA and MARCO: AI-generated Sportscasters</span
              ><span class="ai-newscasters-replacement"
                >Mia and Marco were not the first AI-generated newscasters ever
                created. The very first official AI-generated newscaster is in China
                where XINHUA State News Agency made it to broadcast news 24/7 that
                comes from the Chinese government.<br /><br />When you look at it, AI
                can be a ‘perfect’ broadcaster, with no stuttering, no breaks, no
                expensive salary given, only maintenance -- which means it is a very
                ‘cheap’ alternative to humans.<br /><br />The realization that we are
                being replaced by machines should probably scare us but what more can
                we do but accept the future that we, ourselves, created?<br /><br />We
                are seeking innovation, a very new generation leisurely and enjoying
                our lives that will be easy with this technology. Now, where does the
                line go between innovation and exploitation?<br /><br />GMA also
                emphasizes that MAIA and MARCO are just presenters and are not
                journalists. They also said that they will not replace broadcasters
                who have vast amounts of experience.<br /></span
              ><span class="bold-steps-future">Bold steps towards the Future</span
              ><span class="ai-pros-future"
                >AI is definitely a bold step towards the future, the pros of AI are
                that it can be used as a tool and make a person’s work easy.
                Generating ideas, for example, can be fast and you can even modify it
                by adjusting just a few things and then done! You now have an idea
                made by a machine.<br /><br />GMA’s bold choices lead to different
                tones of opinions but mostly, this move is insensitive to those people
                who pursue media, like me. Others always say that in the media, it’s
                hard to find a job so with these AI-generated sportscasters, it
                basically means our road is not paved that well. They are stuck to
                calling it innovative, but it just sounds like they are cutting off
                branches and killing a mass communication student’s dream to be a
                journalist in the future.<br /><br />So what is innovation in
                newscasting? Is it replacing humans with their job in it and replacing
                them with AI-generated newscasters that can process hundreds of
                information at once? Sounds a bit dystopian to me.<br /><br />I
                understand that we must embrace the change, we must embrace the
                future, but how can I embrace a future where I will never live the
                dream that I have dreamed of?<br /></span
              ><span class="beginning">A Beginning</span
              ><span class="against-ai-useful"
                >As much as I am against the use of Artificial Intelligence, it still
                proves itself useful. Yes, it can be used as a tool and generate ideas
                that I might not think of. Yes, it can point me to something useful
                and yes, it is indeed superior when it comes to efficiency. But it
                still does not beat the emotions of getting a new idea by yourself
                when you were hopeless for hours, it still does not beat the arts
                crafted by human hands and their emotion, and it does not beat the
                moment of mistakes that become a meme or an inside joke among your
                co-workers.<br /><br />AI is indeed innovative but at the same time,
                it is being exploited and humans are the ones who end up getting the
                burn. Instead of that, why don’t we enhance AI and let it help us
                towards our bold step of the future instead of leaving the world of
                human creation behind?<br
