        library activity since the opening of A.Y 2023-2024, recording 17 743
        visits from students, visitors, and faculty from June to October.</span
      ><span class="library-content"
        >"Since the relaxation of social distancing measures, the library
        community has experienced a gradual resurgence, and now it can be
        described as fully revitalized. The library is consistently bustling
        with students who come in to study, complete assignments and coursework,
        and engage in collaborative activities.", head librarian, Ms. Armie
        Barbara Sabiniano, says. <br /><br />In April 2023, the library launched
        the computer log-in system, which utilizes Google Forms to collect data
        on library user attendance by recording students' names, student
        numbers, college departments, years, and programs before entry to the
        facility. <br /><br />The College of Engineering and Architecture (CEA)
        leads the highest library attendance with 4 183 visits and no less than
        250 recorded students monthly. The university's Allied Health and
        Sciences Department (CAHS) follows second with 3 730 logs. College of
        Management and Accounting (CMA) comes third with 3 377. Meanwhile, 3 167
        freshmen from the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) visited the library
        during the first five months of their tertiary education. Students from
        the College of Education and Liberal Arts (CELA) record 1 207 library
        user attendance. 807 and 370 for the College of Information Technology
        Education (CITE) and College of Criminal Justice Education (CCJE),
        respectively.<br />
        <br />Aside from tertiary students, the library has also welcomed
        students from the Senior High School Department, School of Graduate and
        Professional Studies, College of Law, SOG, and faculty, among others.
        <br /><br />In an interview with Ms. Sabiniano, she says that the
        computer log-in system has helped the library manage itself efficiently.
        <br /><br />"Previously, the library relied on manual logbooks for
        attendance, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. Transitioning
        to an online attendance system offers numerous benefits, including error
        reduction, real-time tracking, convenience, accessibility, automation,
        compliance, and customization. This shift streamlines operations, saves
        time, and enhances transparency for librarians, facilitating efficient
        maintenance and record-keeping of user statistics.", Ms. Sabiniano
        stated.<br /><br />The library has also offered online services for
        borrowing and scanning a book, library card application, and even book
        journal recommendations long before the logbook system rolled out.
        <br /><br />"The library's plan is to fully automate its services and
        prioritize student-centered offerings. The recently launched online
        services are just the beginning of this automation effort, which has yet
        to reach its full potential. It would be beneficial for the
        administration to support this library automation project by approving
        the acquisition of additional facilities, library systems, and
        databases."<br /><br />When asked about future developments, such as an
        online seat and table reservation, Ms. Sabiniano answered that the
        library's chair/table-to-student ratio is insufficient and needs to be
        improved to cover such a project. "Once the library is adequately
        furnished with proper ventilation, discussion rooms, study carrels, and
        additional seating, online seat reservation may become necessary.
        However, for now, the library will remain open to all."<br
