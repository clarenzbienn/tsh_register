        2.0: Parliamentary Procedures and Policy-Making Process on September 6,
        2023.<br /></span
      ><span class="reinforcing-leadership"
        >With the theme: “Reinforcing Leadership for the Improvement of Current
        Student Leaders' Abilities and Knowledge” whSSC, LSC, RSO and UWO
        student leaders are invited to participate in the program.<br /><br />Mr.
        Elmer D. Noriega, Assistant Dean of School of Graduate and Professional
        Studies of PHINMA-UPang, is the distinguished resource speaker of the
        program where he discusses the parliamentary process and policy making
        process in order for the student leaders to improve their knowledge and
        enhance their organizational skills.<br /><br />Before the planning of
        the program, Mr. John Renz G. Dalaten, the governor of College of
        Education and Liberal Arts Student Council stated that they want and
        plan to consider the students that will benefit from the program and
        make them more professional in terms of being a student leader who
        served the student and as an individual themselves.<br /><br />Ms.
        Juliana D. Dela Cruz,Chancellor of APSS stated that the benefits of the
        program is to equip student leaders with knowledge and skills for being
        a leader. “Knowing that there are processes and procedures that they
        have to follow, they must be knowledgeable about these matters because
        it is the foundation of leadership and learning agility.” She said as to
        further emphasize the benefits of a student leader with a knowledge of
        the process for being a student leader.<br /><br />Ms. Dela Cruz also
        hoped that the Student Leaders will remember most of the topics.
        Everything that was talked about is crucial in the role of current
        Student Leaders in preparing not only themselves but the whole community
        for a better community with the Leaders they deserve. We learn, unlearn,
        and relearn.<br /><br />When asked about their future plan about the
        program Ms. Dela Cruz said that student leaders must push forward for
        their legacy to continue. “Events like these should still take part in
        our organization's future plans and to all Flames Student Leaders and
        their organizations. We have covered resolution drafting, parliamentary
        procedures, and the policy-making process throughout the whole paralegal
        training for student leaders in two years. Hopefully, training with
        topics like these which are crucial in student leadership will continue.
        Paralegal Training for Student Leaders ensures the betterment of student
        leadership which secures the betterment of the whole studentry as
        well.”<br
